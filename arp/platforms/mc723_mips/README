This is a beta release distributed WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express
or implied.

This is ARP hello world example. It consists of a mips1 processor simulator tied
to a memory by ArchC 2.0 TLM port. No channels, buses or interconnection
structure were used. The software is a simple loop printf to ensure that
processor is running. The main purpose is to use it as a first introduction to
ArchC and ARP at undergraduate laboratory classes.

Run this example:
- Install ARP
  - See toplevel README for notes on system requirements
- Unpack the platform package (probably done :)
  $./arp --unpack helloworld_mips.01.arp.pack
- Edit toplevel Makefile
  - Change the environment variables to correctly point ARCHC, SYSTEMC and TLM
  - Change PLATFORM to helloworld_mips.01
- Run example
  $make run
  
If you don't have mips cross-compiler, you can still run the example by running
make run-bin.
